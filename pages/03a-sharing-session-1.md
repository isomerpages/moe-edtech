#### Montfort Junior School

**Title**

Discovering Interests Through Unstructured Making

**Synopsis**

Makerspaces are not just for making stuff but it is about developing the mindset and unstructured play has a big role in Maker Education. But is unstructured play just free play? Will it work in your school? Unstructured play is hard work for teachers. It actually entails a lot of planning and the courage to let go.  Montfort Junior School will be sharing on the reasons for having unstructured play in the school and its benefits. We will also share about the challenges and how we overcome them. Best of all, you will get to experience an unstructured play activity yourself.
