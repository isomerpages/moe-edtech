#### Pei Hwa Secondary School

**Title**
The Wider Role of Making in the Community

**Synopsis**
Pei Hwa Secondary School has embarked on a maker curriculum through Project Work (PW) since 2018. As part of the maker programme in the school, this PW synergises the school’s Applied Learning Programme (Robotics and Programming) and Lifelong Learning Programme (Community Youth Leadership/ VIA) to equip lower secondary students with the values, knowledge and skills for social innovation. With the school’s innovation cycle as an overarching framework, students are guided to work with different Voluntary Welfare Organisations to identify and resolve community problems using technology and knowledge from different subject matters. In the process, students strengthen their creative thinking and making skills while building on their coding literacy. Hence, this workshop aims to show how maker programmes can be facilitated to enable students’ innovation efforts for the community, and how it can be implemented level-wide.
