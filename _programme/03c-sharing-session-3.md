#### Commonwealth Secondary School

**Title**

Sustaining a School-wide Maker Culture

**Synopsis**

Commonwealth Secondary School adopts the Constructionism education philosophy which posits that people construct new knowledge with effectiveness when they are engaged in constructing personally meaningful products (Papert and Harel, 1991). Therefore, in 2014, we adopted maker education to enhance the educational experience of our students. Since then, our approach has been evolving as we constantly seek ways to build a school-wide maker culture that runs on creativity and innovation. In this presentation, Commonwealth Secondary School will share its ongoing journey and effort to build such an ecosystem in the face of the ever-changing educational landscape. The presentation will include the sharing of our key approaches and insights to our journey, the challenges encountered and ideas for educators to take away which are essential to help drive the maker culture in their own schools.
