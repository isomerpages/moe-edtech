**Title** 

Making to Learn and Learning to Make: A Balanced Approach to Assessment in Maker-Centred and Project-Based Schooling Environments

**Synopsis**

For maker education to take root in sustainable and meaningful ways, assessments need to show what cognitive and non-cognitive skills are being developed, connect to existing frameworks, and be accessible for teachers to adopt and adapt. Evidence of learning strengthens the impact of maker-centred learning and supports open-ended, process-oriented, student-centred learning. The Lab Schools for Student-Centred Learning in the Albemarle County Public Schools District pilots maker education and other student-centred learning instructional and holistic assessment approaches through research partnerships with the University of Virginia (UVA) and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), National Science Foundation (NSF) and the Maker Education Initiative (MakerEd).  In this keynote session, speakers will share on their learning, overview on the various types of assessments as well as challenge assumptions and inspire creative thought for participants with questions like, “Why do we assess?”, “What’s worth assessing?” and “How might a holistic, balanced assessment approach benefit children?”.
